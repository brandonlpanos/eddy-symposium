Images of IRIS's field of view (square insert) superimposed over an image from the Solar Dynamics Observatory of a coronal mass ejection on May 9, 2014. IRIS's spectrogram can be seen as a black horizontal slit in the centre of the image which collects physical information about the state of the solar atmosphere.
